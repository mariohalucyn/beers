		<h1>Why we process your information</h1>

		<p>We generally process your information when we need to do so to fulfill a contractual obligation (for example, to process your subscription payments to use the Beers platform), or where we or someone we work with needs to use your personal information for a reason related to their business (for example, to provide you with a service). Laws in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and in the United Kingdom (“UK”) call these reasons “legitimate interests.” These “legitimate interests” include:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>preventing risk and fraud</li>
			<li>answering questions or providing other types of support</li>
			<li>helping merchants find and use apps through our app store</li>
			<li>providing and improving our products and services</li>
			<li>providing reporting and analytics</li>
			<li>testing out features or additional services</li>
			<li>assisting with marketing, advertising, or other communications</li>
		</ul>

		<p>We only process personal information for these “legitimate interests” after considering the potential risks to your privacy and balancing any risks with certain measures—for example, by providing clear transparency into our privacy practices, offering you control over your personal information where appropriate, limiting the information we keep, limiting what we do with your information, who we send your information to, how long we keep your information, or the technical measures we use to protect your information.</p>

		<p>We may also process your personal information where you have provided your consent. In particular, where we cannot rely on an alternative legal basis for processing, where you direct us to transfer information to a third party, where we receive your data from a third party is sourced and it already comes with consent or where we are required by law to ask for your consent (including in the context of some of our sales and marketing activities). At any time, you have a right to withdraw your consent by changing your communication choices, opting out from our communications or by contacting us.</p>

		<p>Depending on whether you are a merchant, customer, partner, user or visitor, please refer to our supplemental privacy policies, as relevant, to understand our purposes for processing, categories of recipients and legal basis for processing for each type of personal data.</p>

		<h1>How long do we retain your information</h1>

		<p>We will retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we have collected it. To determine the appropriate retention period, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of your personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means and the applicable legal requirements. We will also retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our policies. If you stop using our services or if you delete your account with us, we will delete your information or store your information in an aggregated and anonymized format.</p>

		<p>Depending on whether you are a merchant, customer, partner, user or visitor, please refer to our supplemental privacy policies, as relevant, for further details on the retention of your personal information.</p>

		<h2>What information we collect and share about you</h2>

		<p>To provide our apps and services to you, we must process information about you, including personal information.</p>

		<p>We do not “sell” your personal information as that term is defined under US Privacy Laws.</p>

		<p>Here is a summary of the categories of personal information we may have collected about you over the past 12 months and with whom we may have disclosed that information to, depending on how you use Shopify.</p>
