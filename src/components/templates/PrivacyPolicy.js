		<h1>Why we process your information</h1>
		<p>
			We generally process your information when we need to do so to fulfill a contractual obligation (for example, to process your subscription payments to use the Beers platform), or where we or someone we work with needs to use your personal information for a reason related to their business (for example, to provide you with a service). Laws in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and in the United Kingdom (“UK”) call these reasons “legitimate interests.” These “legitimate interests” include:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>preventing risk and fraud</li>
			<li>answering questions or providing other types of support</li>
			<li>helping merchants find and use apps through our app store</li>
			<li>providing and improving our products and services</li>
			<li>providing reporting and analytics</li>
			<li>testing out features or additional services</li>
			<li>assisting with marketing, advertising, or other communications</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			We only process personal information for these “legitimate interests” after considering the potential risks to your privacy and balancing any risks with certain measures—for example, by providing clear transparency into our privacy practices, offering you control over your personal information where appropriate, limiting the information we keep, limiting what we do with your information, who we send your information to, how long we keep your information, or the technical measures we use to protect your information.
		</p>
		<p>
			We may also process your personal information where you have provided your consent. In particular, where we cannot rely on an alternative legal basis for processing, where you direct us to transfer information to a third party, where we receive your data from a third party is sourced and it already comes with consent or where we are required by law to ask for your consent (including in the context of some of our sales and marketing activities). At any time, you have a right to withdraw your consent by changing your communication choices, opting out from our communications or by contacting us.
		</p>
		<p>
			Depending on whether you are a merchant, customer, partner, user or visitor, please refer to our supplemental privacy policies, as relevant, to understand our purposes for processing, categories of recipients and legal basis for processing for each type of personal data.
